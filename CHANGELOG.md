## 2026-08-11

### Session Media — Video Download Option Disabled
**Files:** `present.html`, `index.html`
**Commit:** `d5754a9`
**Change:** Disabled the browser's built-in **Download** option (and the right-click "Save video as…" menu) on the session video players — both the full-screen Presentation View player (`present.html`) and the in-page preview player (`index.html`). Implemented by adding `controlsList="nodownload noremoteplayback"`, `disablePictureInPicture`, and an `oncontextmenu` guard to the `<video>` elements.
**Reason:** Facilitators could download the session videos from the player's three-dot (⋮) menu.
**Note:** Standard playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume, fullscreen) are unaffected.

### Session Media — "Offline Setup" Button Open/Closed State + SVG Icons
**File:** `index.html`
**Commits:** `47ec684`, plus icon conversion (this batch); supersedes initial version in `d5754a9`
**Change:** The **Offline Setup** toggle now visibly indicates whether its panel is expanded or collapsed. Collapsed = teal styling (matching the adjacent "Open Presentation View" button); expanded = greyed/recessed with the caret rotated up. Added `aria-expanded` for accessibility.
Also replaced the button's two **dingbat arrow characters** (`⬇` download, `▾` caret) with **inline SVG icons** (download glyph + chevron, `currentColor`, matching the site's existing icon style). The chevron rotates 180° when the panel opens.
**Reason:** Button state was previously indistinguishable open vs. closed. Separately, the dingbat arrow glyphs did not render in some environments (they were absent on the production site), leaving the button with no icons; inline SVG renders reliably everywhere.

---

### Session Script — Content Updated from Master Sheet
**File:** `index.html`
**Source:** MoM-Artifacts Master Sheet → Session Script Google Doc
**Change:** Updated the Full Session Script accordion content to match the latest version of the document. Key changes:
- Removed "Waiting Announcement" phase
- "Welcome & Introduction" + "Sadhguru & Isha Intro" merged into a single upfront phase: "Welcome & Sadhguru Introduction" (~3.5 min); intro video now plays at the start, not as an optional late-session segment

## 2026-05-18

### Take It Further — Mobile Layout Fixed
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** The four "Take It Further" cards now stack into a single column on mobile (≤768px) instead of showing as a partial 2-column grid that required horizontal scrolling. Side padding is also reduced on small screens to match the rest of the page.

---

## 2026-05-17

### Session Resources — Accordion Cards & Blocks Unified to Section Teal
**File:** `index.html`
**Commits:** `6002711`, `46a0228`
**Change:** Unified the entire Session Resources section to the section teal (`#7cb8a8`):
- All Session Resources accordion cards received the `c-session` class + a subtle teal tint —
  `.expand-card.c-session { background: rgba(124,184,168,0.08); border-color: rgba(124,184,168,0.22); }`
  plus a teal left-edge bar (`.expand-card.c-session::before { background: var(--c-session); }`).
- "Revisit Training" block: blue `rgba(103,142,204,…)` → teal `rgba(124,184,168,0.08)` / `…,0.22`.
- "Find a session near you" block + its button: amber `var(--vol-amber)` → teal `var(--c-session)`.
**Note:** ⚠️ **Backfilled entry** — this change shipped to the code on 2026-05-17 but was not logged
at the time, so it was likely never applied to prod. This is why prod's Session Resources cards/blocks
differ in color from the staging site. Please apply.

---

### Session Media — Playlist Order Updated
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Moved "Sadhguru & Isha Intro" from position 7 to position 3, immediately after the two Yoga Padhi videos. New order: Yoga Padhi · Waiting Yoga Padhi · Sadhguru & Isha Intro · Intro with Meditation · Managing Thoughts · Participant Experience · App Download QR Code.

---

### Session Media — Auto-Play Removed; Idle Placeholder Added
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** No video plays automatically when the Session Media card is opened. A "Select a video from the playlist to play" placeholder is shown in the video area until the user clicks a playlist item.

---

### Session Media — Presentation View Behavior
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** When the Presentation View window is open, videos play only on the presentation screen. The main page shows an overlay: "Video is playing on the presentation screen. Close the presentation view to preview here." When the presentation window is closed, the main page returns to the idle placeholder rather than auto-playing. Opening the Presentation View while a video is already selected on the main page immediately locks local playback and pushes the current video to the presentation screen.

---

### Revisit Training & Find a Session — Icons Added and Layout Updated
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Both the "Revisit Training" (🎓) and "Find a session near you" (📍) blocks now have an icon on the left with the text and button stacked to the right, consistent with the Submit Post-Session Report card layout. Button stretch bug also fixed.

---

### Session Script — Renamed from "Talking Points"; Short Session Tab Removed; Tab Renamed
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Renamed the "Talking Points" accordion card to "Session Script". Removed the "Short Session" tab. Renamed the "Full Session" tab to "Full Session Script". Updated the "↗ Open file" link label accordingly.

---

### Session Resources — "Find a Session Near You" Moved and Restyled
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Moved the "Find a session near you" block from the bottom of the Session Resources section to directly below the "Revisit Training" card. Restyled the link as a solid amber button for greater prominence.

---

### Booth Setup — New Card Added to Outreach Resources
**File:** `index.html`
**Source:** MoM-Artifacts Master Sheet (Section: Promotion > Sub-Section: Booth Setup)

---

### Email & WhatsApp Templates — Mobile Copy Button Added
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** On mobile (≤768px), a "Copy" button now appears at the top of every template panel across Email Templates and WhatsApp Templates so users don't need to scroll past long text to find it. Desktop experience is unchanged.

---

### Section Headers — Icons Added
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Replaced emoji icons with flat inline SVG icons that inherit the section's theme color via `currentColor`.
- Outreach Resources → Phosphor Icons `megaphone-fill` in amber
- Session Resources → Phosphor Icons `flower-lotus-fill` in teal

---

### Session Finder — Coming Soon Page
**Files:** `index.html`, `session-finder.html` (new)
**Change:** Created `session-finder.html` — a styled coming soon page for the MoM session location finder. The "Find a session near you" button in the Session Kit now links to `http://isha.us/MoMsession-finder`.
**Action required (Isha IT):** Map short URL `isha.us/MoMsession-finder` → `session-finder.html`. This page can later be replaced or the short URL redirected to the actual session finder tool.

---

### Firefox Freeze Fix — Video Preload Removed
**File:** `index.html`
**Bug:** The `<video id="smLocalPlayer">` element had a hardcoded `src` pointing to the Yoga Padhi MP4 with no `preload` attribute. Firefox started downloading the video immediately on page load, causing the browser to freeze.
**Fix:** Removed the hardcoded `src` and added `preload="none"`. Video `src` is now set dynamically only when a user clicks a video item.

---

### BoomBuddy Passcode Updated
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Updated the BoomBuddy access passcode to `LetsB00M!`.
**Note:** This passcode is shared with volunteers via email upon completion of BoomBuddy training. Update the email template accordingly.

---

### Rebrand — "Booom Buddy" → "Boom Buddy"
**Files:** `index.html`, `session-finder.html`, `flyer.html`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Change:** All instances of "Booom" (3 O's) replaced with "Boom" (2 O's) across all site files to match updated branding.

---

### Other Useful Content — Corporate Presentation Deck Added
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Added "Miracle of Mind — Corporate Presentation Deck" as a new entry under Other Useful Content. Links to the Canva deck with a note to make a copy before editing.
